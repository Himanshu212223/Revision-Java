/*	
	In object-oriented programming, a java singleton class is a class that can have only one object
	 (an instance of the class) at a time. After the first time, if we try to instantiate the Java 
	 Singleton classes, the new variable also points to the first instance created. So whatever 
	 modifications we do to any variable inside the class through any instance, affects the variable
	  of the single instance created and is visible if we access that variable through any variable 
	  of that class type defined.
