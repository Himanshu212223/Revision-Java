	Method Overloading :-
	_______________________________________
	
	If 2 or more methods have same name but different signature or argument,
	and we are using these methods based on their arguments, then, it is called Method Overloading.

	- Which method is going to be called is defined at compile time, hence, it is also
		called as Compile time or Static Polymorphism.

	- Constructor can also be overloaded.
	
	- Java main method can be overloaded as well.
		That means we can overload the main method.
