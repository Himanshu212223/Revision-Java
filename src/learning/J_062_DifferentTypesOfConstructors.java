/*	
	CONSTRUCTORS 
	________________________
	
	- Different types of constructors are :
			1. Default or non-parameterized constructor 
			2. Copy Constructor
			3. Parameterized Constructor
			
	- Default constructor is by default provided by the compiler that's why we are able to 
		create the object of class as ClassName object = new ClassName() ;
		
	- If we make a parameterized constructor, then, compiler wouldn't provide default constructor
		and we have to make a default constructor by ourself.
		
	- Copy constructor just creates copies the attribute value of one object to another.
		but, if object1 = object2 is done, then, object1 will be referencing to object2.
		This is kind of Aliasing (i.e., giving another name to a particular variable).
		Any changes in object2 will get reflected to object1 too.
		To avoid this problem, we create Copy Constructor.
			
	- We can define a method having same name as that of class name.
	
	- Constructor can be public, private or protected.
		See next file for more details on how to use private constructor and create new object.
	
	- We use new keyword to create object and = sign is used to create reference.
