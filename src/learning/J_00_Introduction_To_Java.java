Java
___________________________________________


-	Java is a programming language used to develop Enterprise Applications like Webapps, or for development of mobile apps and games.
-	Java was initially called as Blue Team, then, it has given the name as Oak, and then, Java.
-	Currently, it is owned by Oracle.
-	Java is Platform-Independent language because it produces the bytecode which can be run on any platform whether it is a Windows or Mac.
-	Java is a Robust language because it uses a strong Memory Management by using automatic Garbage Collector, and the ability to use Exception Handling 	Mechanism.
	Garbage Collector checks all those variables which are not getting used but holding memory.
-	Java is a Secure Language because it does not provide the direct access to the memory of the variables (i.e., there is not any concept of pointer in 	java unlike that of C++).


Java Platform Editions
___________________________________________

Java SE or Java Standard Edition 
--------------------------------------
-	It is used to make stand-along applications like Access Data Base, File Handline application, etc.

Java EE or Java Enterprise Edition 
--------------------------------------
-	It is used to develop Enterprise Applications like Webapps, etc.

Java ME or Java Micro Edition 
--------------------------------------
-	It is used to make mobile Applications and games, etc.



Java Architecture
___________________________________________

JDK: Java Development Kit
--------------------------------------
-	Java Development Kit contains JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and specific tools.
-	JDK is a Software Development Environment which is used to develop Java Applications.
-	Various JDK tools are:
	Java C: It stands for Java Compiler, compiles the java source code ( .java file extension) into byte code ( .class file extension).
	JDB: It stands for Java Debugger tool, is used to Debug the java code.
	Jar: It stands for Java Archive, used to aggregate or store many files into one zip file.
	Java Interpreter: It is used to convert byte code( .class file extension) into machine code which is ready to JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
--------------------------------------
-	Java Runtime Environment consists of JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and libraries.
-	JRE provides platform to execute the Java Program.
-	Various JVM tools are:
	Class Loader: It is used to Load Machine Code, Link the Requirements, and Initialization of required values.
	Byte-code Verifier: It checks the presence of illegal code.
	Byte-code Interpreter: It converts the byte code ( .class file extension) into Binary Machine Code.
	JIT: It stands for Just In Time Compiler, and is used to boost the performance of the application during runtime.
